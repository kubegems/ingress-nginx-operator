<!-- 
Your release note should be written in clear and straightforward sentences. Most often, users aren't familiar with
the technical details of your PR, so consider what they need to know when you write your release note.

Some brief examples of release notes:
- Use useExistingAlertingGroup field in loki to replace build-in alertingroups
- Store alert rules in new configmap, to avoid overwrite on update.
